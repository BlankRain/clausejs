 [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/speckyjs/specky.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/speckyjs/specky) [![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/specky.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/specky)  [![Size Gzipped](http://img.badgesize.io/speckyjs/specky/master/packages/specky/dist/specky.min.js?compression=gzip&label=min%2Bgzipped)](packages/specky/dist) [![PRs Welcome](https://img.shields.io/badge/PRs-welcome-brightgreen.svg)](http://makeapullrequest.com)

## What

A powerful & highly flexible JavaScript data validation and conformation library that enables you to:

- Build your data validation rules (specs) with composable, regex-like expressions built from primitives predicates such as `and`, `or`, `any`, `cat` (sequences), `shape`, `oneOrMore`, `zeroOrMore`, etc
- Validate and make assertions about your data with these predicate functions
- Conform your data with parsing
- Allows you to define the shape and rules of your functions' arguments, return value and the relation between them
- Conform your data with a range of available shapes of specs to simply data parsing

## Why Specky

Specky aims at helping you build the once-stop app contract you need.

By writing a set of specs for your app *only once*, you can get a lot of leverage out your effort, including

- A clearly-defined contract for your app's functions and data structures
- Runtime validation for your data and functions
- Advanced data conformation that simplifies your code for data processing
- [WIP] Automatically generated documentation (via [specky-docgen](packages/specky-docgen))
- [WIP] React shape validation (via [specky-react](packages/specky-react))
- [Coming soon] Automatically generative test cases for your functions (via [specky-gen](packages/specky-gen))
- A safety harness with more customizable type and behavior constraints that is even more powerful than typed languages such as TypeScript

[Click here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyLBGkS5ICk) to watch a good high-level video on the rationale behind clojure.spec (and thus Specky).

Still need [five minutes](https://signalvnoise.com/posts/3124-give-it-five-minutes) to acknowledge its awesomeness? I think not.

## Quick Example

- TODO

## Documentation

Please refer to the documentation site: http://specky.js.org

## Performance

- [![Size Minified](http://img.badgesize.io/speckyjs/specky/master/packages/specky/dist/specky.min.js?label=min)](packages/specky/dist) [![Size Gzipped](http://img.badgesize.io/speckyjs/specky/master/packages/specky/dist/specky.min.js?compression=gzip&label=min%2Bgzipped)](packages/specky/dist)
- Uses fast NFA-based algorithms in handling complex Specs
- In general, pretty fast.

## Project status
- Alpha. Subject to constant change and improvement based on [feedback](/../../issues/).

## Try it

- [Try it online](https://jsbin.com/fisiyeh/latest/edit?js,console)

## Installation

```bash
npm install specky
```

Or in the `<head>` or `<body>` tag of your HTML:
```html
<script src="//unpkg.com/specky@latest/dist/specky.js"></script>
```

## More Examples

- [Specky in browser](examples/simple.html)
- [Spec'ing promises](examples/promise/index.js)
- [Codebreaker game](examples/codebreaker/index.js)
- In addition, there are plenty of examples in test files under [`/test`](test/).

## Planned Features

Coming soon.

- `specky-docgen`: Automatic documentation generation based on function specs
- `specky-gen`: Generative/Property-based Testing
- `specky-react`: Specky integration for React. A replacement for `React.PropTypes`

## Why not just use ClojureScript + cljs.spec?

The goal for Specky is to provide JavaScript developers as much the benefit as possible derived from the spec system.

Specky API for the most part is kept similar to clojure.spec, except for some differences related to usability and JavaScript-specific conventions.

(Clojure is a wonderful language. If you can use Clojure/ClojureScript, by all means go ahead and try cljs.spec.)

## Run tests

### In Dev mode

```bash
npm run dev
```

### In CI mode
```bash
npm run test
```

## Credit
- Both origin of the idea and API are heavily inspired by Rich Hickey's [clojure.spec](http://clojure.org/about/spec)
- NFA spec matching inspired by Thompson NFA regex matching algorithm, and is based on [afader's implementation](https://github.com/afader/thompson-regex-js)
