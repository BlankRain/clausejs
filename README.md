# Specky ðŸ‘“ [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/settinghead/specky.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/settinghead/specky) [![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/specky.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/specky) [![PRs Welcome](https://img.shields.io/badge/PRs-welcome-brightgreen.svg?style=flat-square)](http://makeapullrequest.com)

## What

A powerful & highly flexible JavaScript data validation and conformation library that enables you to:

- Build your data validation rules (specs) with composable, regex-like expressions built from primitives predicates such as `and`, `or`, `any`, `oneOrMore`, `zeroOrMore`, etc
- Validate and make assertions about your data with these predicate functions
- Assert & validate the shape and properties of your function's arguments and its return value
- Conform your data with a range of available shapes of specs
- Automatically generate test cases for your spec'ed functions

## Performance

- `8.8 kb` minified & gzipped
- Highly performant in handling both simple and complex Specs

## Why

- A complement/alternative to unit testing
- facilitates a better debugging experience
- Auto generation of test cases based on function specs
- Guides you through the initial modeling process of code implementation
- Help create more customizable type and behavior constraints that is more powerful than typed languages such as TypeScript


## Project status
- Alpha. Each new version is subject to constant change based on [bug reports and feature suggestions](/../../issues/).


## Try it

- [Try it online](https://jsbin.com/fisiyeh/latest/edit?js,console)

## Installation

```bash
npm install specky
```

Or in the `<head>` or `<body>` tag of your HTML:
```html
<script src="//unpkg.com/specky@latest/dist/specky.js"></script>
```

## Examples

- [Specky in browser](examples/simple.html)
- [Spec'ing promises](examples/promise/index.js)
- [Codebreaker game](examples/codebreaker/index.js)
- In addition, there are plenty of examples in test files under [`/test`](test/).

## Generative/Property-based Testing

Coming soon.

## Run tests

### In Dev mode

```bash
npm run dev
```

### In CI mode
```bash
npm run test
```

## Credit
- Both origin of the idea and API are heavily inspired by Rich Hickey's [clojure.spec](http://clojure.org/about/spec)
- NFA spec matching inspired by Thompson NFA regex matching algorithm, and is based on [afader's implementation](https://github.com/afader/thompson-regex-js)
