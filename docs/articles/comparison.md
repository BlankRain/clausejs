### Comparison with Other technologies

#### TypeScript

If you do not use TypeScript, you can loosely use Clause as type enforcement at method and modular level.

In fact you can use both Clause and TypeScript together.

- TypeScript mainly concerns with type checking at compile time. Clause (currently) focuses on spec enforcement at runtime.
- Clause is mainly a contract system where TypeScript is a mainly type system.
- Both Clause and TypeScript can be introduced to the application in a gradual manner.
