### Comparison with Other technologies

#### TypeScript

- In fact, nothing stops you from using both Clause and TypeScript at the same time.
- Both Clause can and TypeScript can be used to constrain, guard and regular code behaviors. TypeScript enables you build constraints at both function and statement levels, whereas Clause offers constraints at function module levels.
- Clause's rule system is a lot more flexible and can potentially create more customized constraints
- TypeScript mainly concerns with type checking at compile time. Clause (currently) focuses on clause enforcement at runtime.
- Clause is mainly a contract system where TypeScript is a mainly type system.
- Both Clause and TypeScript can be introduced to the application in a gradual manner.
